Every conversation in the trains, buses, chai shops and hotels was about cricket and if this was the year to end the wait of 28 years. After all, it was a perfect opportunity to send off one of the best the game had seen - Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.</p><p>Here is us watching a group stage match in the hostel I stayed at back then. This was India playing Pakistan - for that one day, the alleyways and canteens were deserted. Everyone was glued to the TV.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/03a28f12-8bf4-4abb-9e33-2cbf4a8a2ab1 alt=2Blog></p><p>India won the Cricket World Cup that year, and who can forget the iconic lines by Ravi Shastri,</p><p><em>“Dhoni finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd! India lift the World Cup after 28 years!”</em></p><p>I cannot comprehend how 12 years have flown by since that moment, And the World Cup is coming home again in October later this year. Could this be our year again? Time will tell.</p><p>2011 also coincided with when I was introduced to capital markets. How ironic that studying in an Engineering college would introduce me to finance. I had met friends who were trading and investing at the time. Even though small sums of money, what they did seemed fascinating. They were discussing companies and technology and whatnot. Having been swayed by fancy jargon, I started helping them pick stocks to invest in. Seemed much more exciting compared to learning programming and information systems. Three years to that day, I found myself interviewing for DE Shaw, India - a hedge fund based out of Hyderabad. I just got lucky that I had the opportunity to work for a firm supporting trading offices worldwide. And one of the first things I did once I joined my first job in 2014 was to revise and check the market size for all the financial sectors in India compared to other countries. I felt at the time it was probably the bedrock on which everything else could be learned.</p><p>Fast forward to today, I have the opportunity to track the markets closely as part of Zerodha. But last week I was at a talk and failed to memorise some numbers on the economy. This is why I decided to write down my thoughts on the market sizes of various financial service sectors.</p><h2 id=capital-formation-whats-that>Capital Formation, what’s that?</h2><p>Check out the excerpt from the budget speech by the Finance Minister of India earlier this year,</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Capital Investment as driver of growth and jobs</strong></em></p><p><em>44. Capital investment outlay is being increased steeply for the third year in a row by 33 per cent to Rs 10 lakh crore, which would be 3.3 per cent of GDP. This will be almost three times the outlay in 2019-20.</em></p><p><em>45. This substantial increase in recent years is central to the government’s efforts to enhance growth potential and job creation, crowd- in private investments, and provide a cushion against global headwinds.</em></p><p><em><strong>Effective Capital Expenditure</strong></em></p><p><em>46. The direct capital investment by the Centre is complemented by the provision made for creation of capital assets through Grants-in-Aid to States. The ‘Effective Capital Expenditure’ of the Centre is budgeted at Rs 13.7 lakh crore, which will be 4.5 per cent of GDP.</em></p><p><em><a href=https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/budget_speech.pdf>Source</a></em></p></blockquote><p>Governments worldwide clearly understand how vital capital expenditure is for the betterment of a nation.</p><p>Capital formation, in simple terms, is all about using resources like money and time to develop physical and financial assets. For example, think of roads, manufacturing facilities, equipment, vehicles and financial assets like stocks, bonds, and other securities. And the expenditure used towards capital formation is called capital expenditure - which most economists and other financial markets commentators refer to. We will focus on financial capital formation throughout this piece, and I will pen a separate blog on the infrastructure sometime later in the year.</p><p>Needless to say, financial capital formation is critical for any economy. Think of a village in any part of India - for the village to grow and develop, there must be infrastructure improvements. Think schools, hospitals, markets and shops/commercial centres. Since the village is inherently not capital rich, there will need to be some form of capital available for the community to build all the things needed for growth. This capital will only be available if enough financial capital is formed, like debt and investments. With more infrastructure comes better living standard in various ways that we know. Even though simplified, this applies to a country as well. For us to grow and develop, we need capital to spend, which is why any government globally focuses on the maturity and stability of the financial industry.</p><p>Specifically for a developing country like ours, one of the most critical aspects of the economy is for governments and financial institutions to enable businesses and industries to expand, innovate, and improve productivity. When businesses innovate and grow, more jobs are created, and ideally also results in knowledge transfer from better economies, which can increase processes&rsquo; efficiency, outputs, and financial health. Overall efficiency also increases the economy&rsquo;s competitiveness, leading to increased GDP and incomes and a higher standard of living. We will get to these finer details later.</p><p>This is something we at <a href=https://zerodha.com/>Zerodha</a> and <a href=https://rainmatter.com/>Rainmatter</a> keep spending time thinking about. Through Rainmatter (Zerodha’s investment arm), where we invest in startups helping people do better with money, help solve climate change or help make healthier choices, we think of investments as our bit towards helping the country with capital formation. We have constantly spoken about how there is a need for domestic capital availability for businesses to break the cycle of poverty and underdevelopment. We are convinced that with the efforts of the Government in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, we can have a non-linear impact on our societies in the long run.</p><p>Enough with the buzzwords of productivity, output and economic development. So all of the improvements economically in a country directly correlate to resources (capital and other ancillary resources) available. Capital is available in various forms in India - equity, debt, or other complex structures. But debt and equity constitute a significant portion of the financial capital available.</p><p>To simplify, Financial capital formation at a country level - we can think of it as an investment of savings by households or government or businesses into various institutions like mutual funds and banks, to be repurposed for other purposes like lending and equity investments. This is the lifeblood of an economy.</p><p>This happens when individuals, businesses, or governments save a portion of their income and deposit it in banks or invest it in financial markets; these funds become available for lending or investing in productive activities or in buying assets that we mentioned earlier.</p><p>Now that we have context into why capital formation is important and how it is supported let’s look at the market sizes of financial services supporting it.</p><h2 id=benchmarking-the-indian-financial-services-market>Benchmarking the Indian financial services market</h2><p><strong>1. GDP and macro data</strong></p><p>We know how GDP is calculated. And since that is common across economies, it gives us a fair idea of different countries&rsquo; spending power and resilience. Seems only fair to start here.</p><p>Let’s start with the GDP of India compared to other countries. And something that sticks out immediately when we look at GDP data for the top 10 largest countries is the GDP per capita difference between India and other countries. Even though India is the 5th largest country GDP-wise, the GDP per capita has a long way to go before it can be compared with other countries on the list.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/eb9181b9-2ed7-43f9-9f25-158666d3b134 alt=2Blog1></p><p>60% of India’s GDP is driven by local consumption of goods and services. And here is an excellent snapshot of the GDP breakup from a report by Blume Venture,</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/22214b43-2be7-4e8d-918f-aef416935787 alt=2Blog2>
<a href=https://blume.vc/reports/indus-valley-annual-report-2023>Source</a></p><p>We can all try to predict what will happen with consumption and other sectors in India, and all of us will agree that there is growth waiting to happen - but the question is when. With middle-income groups seeing an average growth of 5-7%, we will see more consumers in the market today, better employability, and resilient spending powers, which bodes well for us. But there is still a long way to go. Check out the income groups below,</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/13c9ee88-b9ee-4e8e-8d69-afa908dedce9 alt=2Blog3></p><p><a href=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/how-the-middle-class-will-play-the-hero-in-indias-rise-as-world-power/articleshow/101608682.cms>Source</a></p><p>While looking for a few examples of recent surveys on the economy, I found this one by Wasatch. Here is an excerpt,</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Unlike much of the world, India’s economy is still strong</strong></em></p><p><em>The management teams we spoke with— even teams that have historically been more conservative—were positive about the economic outlook for the country. Consumers, hotel operators and cab drivers were equally optimistic. Capital spending and housing appear to be in an upcycle, and banks are reporting non-performing loans near all-time lows. Massive construction projects within cities and capital-spending plans among businesses point to a coordinated effort to spring India’s economy forward. We saw highways, overpasses, bridges and infrastructure being built everywhere. The sense of optimism and excitement among businesses and consumers was quite different from what we read and hear about in many other parts of the world, where recessions have arrived or recession fears are mounting. Economic forecasts confirm our views on the ground, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting real GDP growth of around 6% for India in 2023, one of the highest rates in emerging and developed markets.</em></p><p><em><a href=https://wasatchglobal.com/market-scout-on-the-ground-research-in-india-and-china/>Source</a></em></p></blockquote><p>But there are challenges and things we can improve upon.</p><p>Along with GDP and income, we must also look at tax collections. It is no surprise how few Indians pay any taxes - given the income distribution among the top 1% of the population. And here is the data on the number of taxpayers for FY 22-23
<img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/af8bdb9e-612b-4590-b30e-12003cd104ba alt=2Blog4>
<a href=https://twitter.com/deepakabbot/status/1684065266379165697/photo/1>Source</a></p><p>So it does not matter the number of ITRs filed; what matters is the number of total taxpayers. India must find ways to increase its tax base over the next few years. Higher tax income can be used for more capital formation for the country. This will generate benefits that will percolate all sections of society.</p><p>Check out the GDP contribution and employment % across sectors. 50% of India’s workforce today is concentrated in Agriculture but it contributes just 17-20% of the GDP. In contrast, Services with 30% of the workforce constitute 50% of GDP.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/72964016-ac2e-451b-9942-6daed4eecb08 alt=2Blog5></p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/01c28ee4-a0ba-4418-a007-f10f8bce8ced alt=Fix></p><p>Even though we have come a long way with how farmers are supported and local livelihoods are safeguarded with policies, we need to do more. If we need to grow our GDP over the next decade, we will need to invest in agricultural technology and infrastructure, promote crop diversification, improve market access for farmers, provide financial and social support to rural communities, and encourage agri-business. And finally, as we have more upskilling and education across the population, balancing the transition of labour from agriculture to other sectors while ensuring rural livelihoods and food security is a critical challenge for India&rsquo;s long-term economic development.</p><p>Just before I started penning this piece down, I re-listened to this talk by Mr Maran. This is a must-listen for anyone curious about Indian markets.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGBME-g6bfQ&t=5562s"><img src=![Video]%28https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/77c1ee45-812d-41bb-8446-0c9347f43562%29 alt="Watch the video"></a></p><p><strong>2. Government spending</strong></p><p>Government spending helps stimulate demand for services and products, improves the distribution of social programs and services, and increases infrastructure development among other benefits. Again going back to capital formation. India today spends around 15% of GDP.</p><p>Benchmark this to US and China, at 45% and 15%, respectively.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/1e18d7d6-6f49-4017-ad51-a600c244e8aa alt=2Blog7></p><p>But increasing government spending comes with its own set of challenges. This is why any increase in government spending needs to be well thought out. Increased spending without commensurate revenue can lead to increased deficits, creating upward pressure on interest rates and crowding out private borrowing. There can be misallocation of resources, inflation like what we saw in the US for the past few years.</p><p>But with a balanced approach and gradual increase in government spending, we can create better infrastructure and social programs and strengthen the fabric of our economic industry with as few shocks as possible.</p><p><strong>3. Debt market</strong></p><p>For Government to spend towards capital expenditure, there are a few avenues for collecting revenue or funds. Firstly, the Direct and indirect taxes. Secondly, the debt market, where governments can sell bonds to raise funds. Apart from just the government, even corporations can sell bonds to raise capital for expenditure.</p><p>This is why debt markets form an essential part of a country’s economy - they supercharge the economy as we described in the example of a growing village earlier. A mature and deep debt markets mean easier access to capital, and lower interest costs, which will help us grow further by building better infrastructure and market linkages.</p><p>Here is what the global debt market looks like. The US again leads the way with 31 trillion dollars of the debt market. India is at 1.3 trillion dollars.</p><h3 id=rankings>Rankings</h3><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/c7921140-b9c8-4211-b23b-aac7b75e6091 alt=2Blog8></p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/a47f04d4-3a3c-4238-8b7d-8f13470a2ede alt=2Blog9></p><h3 id=debt-market-snapshot-across-countries>Debt market snapshot across countries###</h3><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/30a655c9-4be1-48f9-b3ca-ccb2ccdd9857 alt=Fix2></p><p><strong>4. Banking</strong></p><p>There are several reasons why banks are important for an economy - financial inclusion, credit availability, and savings mobilization are some of the notable reasons.</p><ul><li><p>The Indian banking system consists of 12 public sector banks, 22 private sector banks, 46 foreign banks, 56 regional rural banks, 1485 urban cooperative banks and 96,000 rural cooperative banks, and cooperative credit institutions.</p></li><li><p>In 2001, the total outstanding loans of Indian banks stood at ₹5.1 trillion, or 23.9% of the country’s GDP of the time. By September 2022, the figure had grown to ₹130.4 trillion, or 50.3% of GDP.</p></li><li><p>Meanwhile, the total bank deposits have jumped from ₹9.6 trillion, or 45% of GDP, as of end-March 2001, to ₹175.4 trillion, or 67.6% of the GDP.</p></li></ul><p>While the growth appears to be sharp, the interesting thing is that the size of Indian banking has stagnated for over a decade. The lending of banks has remained around 50-53% of the GDP since March 2009 (with 2020-21 being an exception due to covid-19), and deposits have remained between 67-70% of GDP.</p><blockquote><p><em>In the words of Mr KV Kamath,</em></p><p><em>How do you see the state of Indian banking today?</em></p><p><em>As the numbers reveal, the banks are in a very healthy state in terms of the book and the capital base. Growth rates will mimic the GDP growth, with about 20% higher numbers, so about 10-12% will be part of the course.
Deposit growth will be fairly adequate to meet credit growth. I think double-digit growth is good growth.
Here are a few more graphs/data on the Indian banking size. And as you can see in the table representing banking assets and countries with higher assets - India is a fraction of some of the leading countries. Higher bank assets ideally should translate to financial inclusion, better access to credit, better cost of credit, better capital formation, and better overall growth of incomes, but we will need the policy to route all the banking penetration to the hinterlands in India. Over the next 5-10 years, India needs to scale up its penetration of banking and also increase the credit facilities available for individuals and businesses.</em></p></blockquote><p>Here is where India ranks with banking assets,</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/a98979d9-eec4-4658-9959-5dc4a893b1af alt=2Blog11></p><p><strong>5. Insurance</strong></p><p>There is a long way to go for India’s Insurance industry - the current penetration of insurance is around 4% as per the Economic Survey 2022-2023 (the significant drop from 5% around 2010 is an aftereffect of the market crash of 2008 and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/insure/what-the-new-regulation-means-for-existing-and-prospective-customer-of-ulips/articleshow/6108415.cms?from=mdr">regulations around ULIPs</a></p><p>Here is the depth of Indian insurance market,</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/21c3e22a-ce67-4ca7-bf84-22003e10ee9b alt=2Blog12></p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/a935c6e1-6e61-4ee4-8ea2-e1deb01b22ee alt=2Blog13></p><blockquote><p><em>The penetration of Indian insurance industry is less than 5% of the GDP. IRDAI data shows that India’s insurance penetration was 4.2% of the GDP in 2021-22. In terms of penetration, India is far behind the global average of 7% of the GDP.
In terms of penetration, India is ranked 20 in FY 2021-22. Countries like Taiwan, South Africa, the USA and UK report higher penetration of 14.8%, 12.2%, 11.7% and 11.1% respectively.</em></p><p><em><a href=https://cafemutual.com/news/insurance/28335-insurance-penetration-is-just-42-much-less-than-the-global-average-of-7>Source</a></em></p></blockquote><p>One of the issues with deepening the insurance market in India is the education and awareness around it. A large chunk of India’s population is one health or life event away from considerable financial and social health damage. And Insurance industry can play a role in bringing more Indians to plan for the future and safeguard their financial well-being.</p><p>Here is my colleague Bhuvan explaining the role of Insurance in a no-frills <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/coin/coin-newsletter/coin-newsletter-3-starting-troubles>financial planning post</a></p><p>Even though Insurance does not directly does not add to capital formation, the insurance companies themselves directly contribute to investments in the economy. Insurance companies with all the float (premiums collected) must find investment opportunities to make up for the liabilities. And hence a higher penetration of insurance would mean more capital coming towards capital markets to support some of the businesses that can not only impact jobs but also create more opportunities for economic prosperity.</p><p>A small snapshot of the entire Indian insurance industry -</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/f3e43393-71eb-4858-89d5-6dd954646f24 alt=2Blog14></p><p>There is a case to be made for higher insurance penetration in India. But again, the lack of avenues to get educated on the right insurance policy to purchase makes it challenging to understand if a higher market penetration would translate into benefits for retail clients. The following 10 years will be great to see if we can grow the insurance market and if there is potential for Indian markets to utilize digital channels or if India will assert itself as a market where partner and offline networks will be essential and inseparable from insurance purchase decisions.</p><p><strong>6. Stock markets</strong></p><p>Equity markets directly create opportunities for capital formation. I dont think I need to explain a lot about equity markets.</p><p>Over the past few years, the stock market has been in the news for adding several new retail participants. Today around 4% of India’s population participates in the equity markets. This number is of course significantly higher in other developed countries like China and US.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, for decades Indian households have been risk-averse and continue to be so. There is more demand for bank fixed deposits and gold perhaps than for ownership of business. But with a new generation of wealth earners coming through, who are probably not privy to the difficult times of the past, we see behaviour shifting.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/3e1a89c1-d14c-476e-89e8-7e66f1fbd47d alt=2Blog15></p><p>India’s market capitalization is at 300 lakh crore - way back in September 2003, it was just Rs 10 lakh crore.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/b2b5598a-b349-4860-af6d-66bd6c9ce18e alt=2Blog16></p><p>But Indian capital markets also have a long way to go if it has to impact the economic upheaval we are all hoping for.</p><h2 id=fintech-consumer-markets>Fintech consumer markets</h2><p>Given I also spend a lot of time looking at the fintech market specifically, I wanted to share a bit about the Fintech market size given all the frenzy.</p><ul><li><p>Indian FinTech industry’s market size was $ 50 Bn in 2021, estimated at ~$ 150 Bn by 2025. India has around 7,500 fintech startups. From 2014 to mid-2022, the sector received more than $30 billion in funding.

As of Jan 2021, according to NSE, around 1.6 crores or 16 million customers had traded once a year last year (last 12 months). This again is not a unique count, so if a customer had traded with two brokers, it would show up twice.

If we are to truly become a country with higher GDP, we will need to deepen our government spending, debt markets, and all the other critical sources of capital formation.</li><li>The key to unlocking the next wave of growth in India is to enable domestic capital to support domestic businesses. We must reduce our dependence on imports, which will only happen if we invest in infrastructure and capacity building today.</li><li>Female labour participation rates have steadily declined — from 26% in 2005 to roughly 20% in 2019. Less than 7% of the urban women population has independent financial income. Over the next few years, we must improve this to walk the talk with holistic economic development.</li><li>India’s GDP is around 3 trillion USD today compared to the United States, with 26 trillion USD, and China, with 18 trillion USD.</li><li>The GDP per capita is also nuanced. Even though we see the $2000 per capita GDP on average - if we remove the top 30-40 million of our population, the GDP per capita dips to $700.</li><li>India’s GDP is growing at 5-6% annually. Compare it with the United States, which has 2% annual growth, and China, which has 5-6% growth. And here lies the difference. Even though the growth rate for the US is 2%, the addition to GDP annually is around 0.5 billion, whereas India is adding only 0.2 billion every year. And China is adding around 1 billion in GDP gross value.</li><li>India certainly needs to increase the taxpaying base, and one of the lowest-hanging fruits is to enable higher participation of women in the workforce.</li><li>Global debt markets are three times bigger than global equity markets. Something that gets lost in all the noise around equity market performance. This is also why there has been a lot of noise around the interest rate hikes in the last couple of years, given how much of an impact it has on household savings and investments.</li><li>Govt spending, debt markets, equity markets, banking assets, and insurance - these sectors need to grow significantly for India to do well socially and economically.</li><li>Even though India is 5th largest economy in the world, the financial industry size is nowhere close to some other countries, and that needs to change to help some of the lower rungs of society.</li><li>While the growth rate compared to lower base rates seems great, the next few years need significantly improved efforts to reach the hinterlands with financial services and focus on overall growth rather than the concentrated growth we see today. Even though this is more of a global phenomenon (concentrated wealth creation), the key to avoiding future conflicts will be ensuring we enable prosperity to a larger section of our population quickly.</li><li>VC/PE risk capital will also be important as India unlocks growth. India is at an inflexion point where the potential or the market, along with demographics, makes it easier to start up a business. Along with founders, we will also need risk capital. But India needs a significantly different approach to what worked on Sand Hill Road - the silicon valley playbook replication might not work, as I explained in my <a href=https://dineshpai.in/blog/venture-capital-in-2023-and-what-lies-ahead/>previous blog</a>.</li></ul></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/economy>Economy</a></li><li><a href=/tags/financial-services>Financial services</a></li><li><a href=/tags/data>Data</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Dinesh Pai &copy; 2023</footer></body></html>
