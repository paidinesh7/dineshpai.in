What a year it has been - from wars raging to AI being the talk of the town, we were exposed to developments fully unprepared for all of them. Speaking of unprepared, I was definitely unprepared for how all the sports teams I followed would do this year - the Indian cricket team seems to be in a crisis after probably a decade, Manchester United seems to just find new ways to lose games, Scuderia Ferrari F1 team seems to always find ways to put themselves in a tough spot, and the New York Yankees lost the World Series. Sigh. Trust me when I say this, I learnt so much about patience by just being a spectator of sports. Nonetheless, there have been so many other notable things that I have ended up learning. Here's just a few of them, 

- Long-term view of everything - for the longest time I have heard so many leaders across business, sports and art prefer evolution over revolution. With almost everything, for the most part, evolution really seems to be the way to go. Want to learn a new skill? Start spending 5 mins each day and ramp it up. Want to get good at writing? Write short posts before writing a blog. Want to build something? Start with the outline and go from there. This applies to almost every trade, job, and walk of life. If you are an engineer, start learning whatever it is that you want to learn. If you are a product designer, think about carefully curating the experience rather than a massive overhaul. The reason why I feel this needs to be said is because of how human beings are wired. We are all trained to think that new things and rebuilding from scratch are more valuable, worthy and appreciated. But the reality is that it takes more skill, talent and focus to evolve. So the next time you are tasked with a project, think of this before you decide to burn down the existing structure and rebuild from scratch. Dont get it wrong, there will be times when you really have to do it all over again and reinvent the wheel, but it should not really be your first instinct. 

- Momentum is everything -
