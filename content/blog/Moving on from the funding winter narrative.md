Earlier this weekend, I was at the [HSX Headstart Summit](https://headstart.in/hsx) and was asked a few questions about the startup ecosystem prevalent in India. Headstart is an annual event that aims to bring together entrepreneurs from various parts of the country to share stories and interact with each other. It was amazing to notice that there were several teams from non-metro cities working on building amazing companies. Undoubtedly, this is what will help us do better as a country and an economy, having more entrepreneurs building localised solutions for various parts of the country. I don’t think any of us would have imagined that this would happen in India a few years ago. But kudos to us as a country for achieving this. 

But since the dawn of 2023, times don't seem as rosy as in the past couple of years anymore. I was asked to speak about it on a panel at Headstart. I realised it would be nice to also pen my thoughts on this topic down as a blog, with detailed context. Rest assured, I did not reference or regurgitate the Zero-Interest Rate Phenomenon (ZIRP) phenomenon at Headstart. I won't go into it too much in this blog as well. But since ZIRP gets quoted quite often for the troubles facing the Indian VC ecosystem, here is a quick explainer.  

ZIRP is quoted often placing the blame for all economic turbulence, in this case, specifically the venture capital bubble of the yesteryears, at the doorstep of the Federal Reserve (Fed). It all started after the 2008 financial crisis when the Fed started reducing [interest rates](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/why-do-interest-rates-matter.htm) to stimulate the US economy. While it was easy to get this going, the rate cuts meant interest rates reached zero and negative at times when adjusted for inflation, and it stayed there for far longer than anybody had planned. The pandemic then further inhibited the interest rate hikes in favour of economic stimulus and fear of economic downturns. 

But while it lasted, everyone lapped it up. While the US treasury rates remained low, capital piles from the US started finding ways to earn more yields or returns since the fixed-income returns were unattractive. This is where it gets interesting - the US is the largest financial services market in the world. That means, all the excess money from the US would eventually flow to other markets. That brings the Indian VC asset class into the picture given how India was one of the promising emerging markets for several reasons - young working population, shiny consumption story, govt and policy pushes and the emergence of talented VC funds and entrepreneurs. Since most VC funds from India promise an annual 25% IRR in dollar terms no less, foreign money found its way into the country. All this has been written at length, and the ZIRP era ended with headlines like [‘End of the Free Money’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/11/techscape-zirp-tech-boom). Given all the macroeconomic difficulties, the Fed initiated the steep hike of interest rates for 4 decades amounting to about 4.5%! Staggering. But anyway, now that ZIRP has ended, all the money floating around emerging economies like India has been repatriated briskly. For now, this is all you need to know, and the rest of the blog is more about what else has been troubling the VC ecosystem in India. Here is a graph of the Fed rates if you are curious to check the historical Fed interest rates since 2000.

Okay, getting back to the VC troubles I spoke about at Headstart. So now that VC funding in India has dropped from 35 Bil USD in 2021 to maybe 10-12 Bil USD (projected) for 2023 - it is quite natural for everyone to speak about how the trouble that is facing the industry today is just because of lack of funding and primarily due to the ZIRP phenomenon. That is quite a neat trick and probably a way to brush all the other challenges under the rug. And boy, challenges have festered over the past couple of years. 

For some context, VC funding that found its way onto Indian startup balance sheets in 2021 and 2022 was almost $65 bil! And the amount of VC funding between 2012 and 2021? Almost $50 bil. You see the problem right there - a classic bubble ripe for the harvest. The bubble burst sometime in mid-2022, but it also exposed the underlying malaise that had festered for quite some time. 

So, the question must be asked, though, how did it all come to this? We certainly dont have anyone else to blame but ourselves—a collective failure to apply common sense when we most needed it. 

And yeah, in hindsight, it is easy to dissect the situation today and suggest what could have been better. The argument being, if we knew the consequences of their actions, we would have acted to avoid it at all costs. Well, it was pretty obvious from the get-go what would happen. We didn't pay attention.

It does not take anyone too long to identify how cyclical the VC industry is - while it might look like the good times will never end, it always does. Stories of the dot com bust and the global financial crisis come to mind. Yet, nobody behaved rationally. 

Here is what the last decade of VC funding availability looked like, 

![image-1561023452534-470385611be69f396bde085256e4a263](https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/1fc9b485-0ed4-42ba-9270-7cc6a6d8139b)

And where have we seen a similar peak and dip? Yep, 2000. And if you look closely also in 2008. 

![2023-09-29_21-41](https://github.com/paidinesh7/dineshpai.in/assets/79692173/ebe1ca73-8d1b-4522-9687-944f91efdfe8)

So, yep, this is quite similar to the lull of the post-dot-com crash. Uncannily similar. 

Also, check out this excerpt, 

>Over the past few days, two venture capitalists have expressed their worries about the current state of the US startup community. In essence, both are saying that startups are burning through too much cash and that the overall risk currently taken in Silicon Valley is excessive. It’s not the first time people have warned about a new tech bubble. The period of prudence that followed the financial crisis of 2009 is officially over. 

While this excerpt is from an [article in 2014[(https://www.statista.com/chart/2732/venture-capital-investments-in-the-us/), it could also describe what happened last year. The point being - what’s happening today is not new. This has happened before; as I said, it will happen again. But could we all resist the urge not to play along next time? Time will tell. And if I was to guess, I dont think we can help ourselves. 

So why are we talking of the end of the world? And with that, here are my thoughts on navigating the next few years. 

**Why are we here?

In its truest form, venture capital was meant to be risk capital for high-growth businesses. This, by definition, also means not all businesses are venture-fundable and dont necessarily need to be. But all of this went out of the window the past two years. Every potential venture company raised money at unexplainable valuations. Be it a function of capital available or a function of our greed, it doesn't matter. The result was always going to be pain. 

I want to also point out in no uncertain terms that what is happening today has more to do with how VC investors have done business over the past couple of years than anything else. Not just VCs, the hedge funds, the Corporate VC arms, crossover funds, family offices and everyone else who participated in the madness. I explained all of it [here earlier](https://dineshpai.in/blog/venture-capital-in-2023-and-what-lies-ahead/). Competing for deals, egging on founders to raise capital when possible, FOMO, greed for marking up portfolios, etc. But you get what I am saying. 

There is primarily one word for the culprit - ***valuation***. 

As the pandemic receded, with all the VC moolah at its disposal, the market switched from an investor market to a founder market. Founders and startups had multiple offers for the fundraise they were planning, and guess which ones won. Yep, the termsheets with the highest valuations. 

For a VC investor, the name of the game is to not miss out on the winners. So yeah, that’s precisely what they did. Outbid each other, and ensured they invested in startups at any valuation that would get the deal across the line. But not a second was spare to think how the founders would eventually rationalise the valuation. Well, the metaphorical albatross was now around the founder's neck. 

All the layoffs, cost cutting, and pressure to demonstrate profitability are all a function of the valuations ascribed to the startups: pain, pain and more pain. 

Not only did investors get on to the cap table at ludicrous valuations, but they also sold stakes in companies to other investors at a markup to these already high and unexplainable valuations. 

Cue the short scene from the movie Margin Call - so yeah, the VC market will be sedated for a few years. 

{{< youtube id="m_IpkRG0YnU" >}}

While the repercussions have been playing out, we have seen the army of angel and venture investors retreat and spend time reviewing their portfolios. We have also seen crossover funds call it a day for venture investing and return to public investing - have you heard Tiger Global invest the past few months? Certainly not. We have also seen corporate VC arms quite intriguingly repurpose focus towards managing portfolios rather than look at new investments. It was clear that they were all never here for the long run anyway, but we all celebrated them while they lent us some time.

On the other hand, startups who dealt with the investors, have found themselves in uncharted territory. Crunched for cash, and stuck in a challenging fundraising environment, it is quite distressing to see. The valuations and dilutions of the previous rounds have reared their ugly head. Difficult times, indeed. 

Founders also played along, though. How else do we explain - 

- Startups raising subsequent venture rounds within 6-8 months
- Hiring and expanding teams by several magnitudes overnight 

While I am all for venture investing, all parties throwing all caution to the wind was certainly not the prudent thing to do. The growth-at-all-costs mindset had to come to an end. And so it did pretty dramatically right before our eyes over the past year in 2023. 

While writing this piece, one thing escapes me, though - just how the boards of these startups let this happen. It is unexplainable. Until I heard Mr. Damodaran speak at an event recently about corporate governance, he said, and I quote, “In the dictionary, grief comes only a few pages after greed”. It could not have been aptly summarised. [Here is an article](https://excellenceenablers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/From-Greed-to-Grief_Final.pdf) from him on why responsibility and accountability are critical for any company - yes, at any stage, right from infancy. So, let's speak about corporate governance, shall we?

**Corporate governance

When I think of corporate governance, I think of Infosys—the poster organisation for top-notch leadership and management in India. While the startup ecosystem keeps talking up Infosys, very few have imbibed the values that made Infosys what it is today. For Infosys, what was corporate governance all about? 

>Good corporate governance requires diligent adherence to principles that remove the twin perceptions of agency problems and asymmetric information.
>[Source](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/gBPrNbYGlFWaNVEKz7vFIM/Lessons-in-corporate-governance-at-Infosys.html)

Here is an excerpt from [another article](https://www.thecorporategovernanceinstitute.com/insights/lexicon/why-does-corporate-governance-matter-a-look-back-at-history/) describing the history of corporate governance, 

>In the early 90s, a string of corporate scandals prompted the government to commission a report – the Cadbury Report – which contained the framework for a new set of rules.

Adrian Cadbury's report also deals with guidance on two things primarily - conflict of interest and information asymmetry. 

Well, here in lies the problem. There were several startups which failed to have clear governance structures in place. It is understandable why this might have happened - with investors on boards with short-term views, things were never meant to go well. It was a golden straightjacket at best. And obviously, this played such a big part in the pain we see today. 

You see, the incentive for the investors was not to stick around for the long run but to ensure the company generates enough yield when exiting the investment. Which meant forcing the founders’ hands to do that might not necessarily be suitable for the business. Yep, it's quite sad. 

Corporate governance is quite simple - it is all about doing the right things, not because someone is watching, but only because it is the right thing to do. Did the boards of all struggling startups do the right things? Certainly not. Blame the misalignment of incentives, but there is no escaping the responsibility. 

While the boards should have spent a significant chunk of their time discussing tough questions of the business with the founders and helping them build a long-term vision for the team, the debates that ensued were more about valuations and new fundraisers—money on the table. 

Now that we are here, what happens now? 

**What now? 

Now that I have described the problem in some detail, let’s look at the way forward for the ecosystem.

1. Good businesses will never really face funding winters. Yep, you read that right. While I haven't built a business myself, this is me speaking from my experience watching and listening to some of the founders I get a chance to interact with at Rainmatter. 

We must never judge the success of a startup based on its ability to raise venture rounds. But look at basic features in teams where they are solving a real problem, have a passionate team to stick through the difficult times, have good governance, plan for good unit economics, and demonstrate a path to running the business without VC dollars, to state a few. This alone will help several founders reimagine how they want to build businesses. And will have access to something that was taken away - Freedom to run the business how they would like to. After all, the founders and the founding teams are the soul of any startup. 
 
2. Founding teams must remind themselves that equity is precious, and parting ways with it must need some real convincing. Even if it is a VC fund that has delivered several successful companies, it is always prudent to be careful when anyone offers equity capital. 

While it is quite easy for an investor to draw up a fundraising plan, more founders should question if they need to raise the money. This is because once the money is in the bank, the clock starts ticking for the investor. If you are not utilizing the money, questions will be asked, and startups may eventually be nudged as well to do things they dont want to or didn't mean to—quite a situation to be in for a brief lack of concentration. 

And my view on this is an extension of the saying, more money only brings more problems. Unless, of course, the business plans to spend the money on growing the business sustainably. And, marketing/promotions and other discretionary spending might not qualify as prudent spending. I hope founders will spend time thinking long and hard going forward if they need more money from investors.

3. There are no free lunches or free refreshes for a startup - as a founder, if you are building a startup, remember that there are no extra takes for the business and no course corrections possible in most cases if things go from bad to worse. This means at every step, care must be taken to consider long-term implications before charting the course. 

4. We will now return to the times when a company reaching the Series B and C stage of VC funding exhibits characteristics of mature organisations. All the euphoria of the past few years helped startups remain private longer, and that meant it was okay not to have essential guardrails in place by the time the company raises more than 3-4 rounds of funding. All of that rightly will now come to an end. Companies will be expected to consider how they can mature faster and grow sustainably. This is undoubtedly a positive and must be the norm for years.

5. Continue to solve for uniqueness and something that you are passionate about. Because when things go wrong, the only thing that will keep startups from giving up will be the purpose and passion the team has. 

>Every worthwhile accomplishment has its stages of drudgery and triumph: a beginning, a struggle and a victory. — Mahatma Gandhi.

So, teams must certainly need to plan for the struggle phase of entrepreneurship, because there is a high probability that there is going to be struggle. The journey is never going to be easy and gets difficult with time. 

6. Never think of growth at all costs - for founders and investors alike. Period.

7. Hopefully, VC teams look beyond metro cities and support founders solving for sectors like climate and health, which need immediate attention. The metro startups are building for a fraction of our population - 100-200 million at best. What about the rest of the billion+ folks in various parts of India? We need more teams working to serve this larger section that has not been paid attention to. This will not only allow for larger surface areas for investment but will also diversify the portfolio. But in the bigger picture scheme of things - this will help the country also do well economically. 

**Conclusion

Even though this entire piece is about how we have collectively failed as an ecosystem, there are some positive shoots nonetheless. 

With all the activity, being an entrepreneur in India is a viable career choice - it was not a few years ago. Every household in India may today house an entrepreneur in their capacity. It is beautiful indeed. 

Further, India today houses investors looking at almost every sector, which says something. If you are solving a real problem in any sector, you will find help. This is quite a dramatic shift from the last decade, where passion and pursuit of meaning might not have gotten you too many supporters.  Further, a realization has also set in about the need for domestic capital for entrepreneurship in India, and this has received considerable push from the Govt as well. 

While we have seen a crazy fundraising environment, some of the previous successful startups we all adore have been built in the toughest times. Now is a good time to gather thoughts as a founder and get cracking on what they love the most - solving difficult problems. And pay attention to some things we erred in the past few years. 

That being said, I would like to conclude that none of us should take anything for granted and learn from the experience of a venture slowdown. But I reiterate that the room for error available to a startup is a fraction of what a VC firm has at its disposal. I hope all of us internalize this for the rest of the next few decades.
