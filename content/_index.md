# Hello.

![](static/images/dinesh.jpg ".")

I grew up on the banks of River Seetha in Udupi. Having watched everyone in the family build small businesses, I had decided early in life that I would always want to find my way towards capital markets. Once I graduated from engineering in 2014, I joined D.E Shaw India, a hedge fund. I was amazed at how much more there was to learn and went and got my MBA in 2019 from the cleanest city on earth, Calgary, Canada.

The period from 2010 until 2020 was about learning everything in finance and investments. In the process, I was bitten by Venture Capital and how VC investing could potentially build the next notable technology or product. When I left for Canada in August of 2017, I knew I would be back in India to work for an Indian company. And it all came together in 2020 when I met the amazing team at Zerodha. I had followed Zerodha for 6 years at the time, and it was serendipitous that I was lucky enough to meet the team. I currently work at [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com/), where I help with investments in private markets through [Rainmatter](https://rainmatter.com/). I am also passionate about projects that can help solve climate change and safeguard livelihoods most at risk [Rainmatter Foundation](https://rainmatter.org/).

A lot of finance is just history repeating itself, and since I read a bunch of blogs and listen to a bunch of podcasts weekly, I felt summarizing some of the content and adding my thoughts for everyone to check out would help me learn more and improve.
