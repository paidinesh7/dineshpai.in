We have nearly a million registered startups, increasing 200x since 2016, adding around 9 Lakh direct job opportunities since 2017. The past two years, 2021 and 2022, have attracted almost 60 billion USD in venture capital funding. Compare that with the 8-year period between 2012 and 2020, when just 50 billion USD was invested in Indian startups.</description></item><item><title>Moving on from the funding winter narrative</title><link>https://dineshpai.in/blog/moving-on-from-the-funding-winter-narrative/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dineshpai.in/blog/moving-on-from-the-funding-winter-narrative/</guid><description>Earlier this weekend, I was at the HSX Headstart Summit and was asked a few questions about the startup ecosystem prevalent in India. Headstart is an annual event that aims to bring together entrepreneurs from various parts of the country to share stories and interact with each other. It was amazing to meet several startups from non-metro cities, who were all working on building excellent companies. Undoubtedly, this will help us do better as a country and an economy, having more entrepreneurs build localised solutions for various parts of the country.</description></item><item><title>Venture Capital: 2023 and beyond</title><link>https://dineshpai.in/blog/venture-capital-in-2023-and-what-lies-ahead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dineshpai.in/blog/venture-capital-in-2023-and-what-lies-ahead/</guid><description>Three decades after the first Venture Capital (VC) firm mushroomed in the US, in 1975, risk capital found its way to India. Even though there were several instances of accidental VC underwriting businesses before 1975, the first formal VC scheme in India was through Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) interest-free loans. It then took another decade and a half before ICICI and UTI came together to launch a formal Venture Capital Scheme in 1988.</description></item></channel></rss>
