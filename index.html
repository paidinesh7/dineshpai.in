I hail from Udupi, and I am a typical computer science engineer with an MBA. All of my engineering years between 2010 and 2014 were spent learning about finance and investments. I was bitten by the venture capital bug at an early age. And since nobody takes an engineer seriously with investments, I went out and got my MBA from the cleanest city on earth, Calgary, Canada. I currently work at Zerodha, where I help with investments in private markets.</p><p>A lot of finance is just history repeating itself, and since I read a bunch of blogs and listen to a bunch of podcasts weekly. And I felt summarizing some of the content for everyone to check out will be nice. I also have musings on the investments space and will regularly share my thoughts. I am also passionate about projects that can help solve climate change and safeguarding livelihoods most at risk.</p><p>Check out <a href=/blog>my blog</a>.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Dinesh Pai &copy; 2023</footer></body></html>
